1) Mary had a little lamb
2) Little lamb, little lamb
3) Mary had a little lamb
4) Its fleece was white as snow
5) And everywhere that Mary went
6) Mary went, Mary went
7) Everywhere that Mary went
8) The lamb was sure to go
9) He followed her to school one day
10) School one day, school one day
11) He followed her to school one day
12) Which was against the rule
13) It made the children laugh and play
14) Laugh and play, laugh and play
15) It made the children laugh and play
16) To see a lamb at school
17) And so the teacher turned him out
18) Turned him out, turned him out
19) And so the teacher turned him out
20) But still he lingered near
21) And waited patientlyâ€¦
